# face-recognition-lbph
Face recognition for attendance system using local binary patterns algorithm.

this program is written mostly in Python using OpenCV library and TkInter as its GUI.

First time I created this program, it's intended to finish my thesis project, but luckily, I was falling in love with these things and now I'm making more projects related to data science or machine learning and I will post my another project as my on-progress project is completed.
